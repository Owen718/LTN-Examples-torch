All the operators included in this module support the traditional NumPy/PyTorch broadcasting.

    It aggregates the truth values of the closed formulas given in input, namely the formulas
    :math:`\phi_1, \dots, \phi_n` contained in the knowledge base :math:`\mathcal{K}`. In the notation,
    :math:`\mathcal{G}_{\\theta}` is the :ref:`grounding <notegrounding>` function, parametrized by :math:`\\theta`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    agg_op : :class:`ltn.fuzzy_ops.AggregationOperator`, default=AggregPMeanError(p=2)
        Fuzzy aggregation operator used by the `SatAgg` operator to perform the aggregation.

    Attributes
    ----------
    agg_op : :class:`ltn.fuzzy_ops.AggregationOperator`, default=AggregPMeanError(p=2)
        See `agg_op` parameter.

    Raises
    ----------
    :class:`TypeError`
        Raises when the type of the input parameter is not correct.

    Notes
    -----
    - `SatAgg` is particularly useful for computing the overall satisfaction level of a knowledge base when :ref:`learning <notelearning>` a Logic Tensor Network;
    - the result of the `SatAgg` aggregation is a scalar. It is the satisfaction level of the knowledge based composed of the closed formulas given in input.

    Examples
    --------
    `SatAgg` can be used to aggregate the truth values of formulas contained in a knowledge base. Note that:

    - `SatAgg` takes as input a tuple of :class:`ltn.core.LTNObject` and/or :class:`torch.Tensor`;
    - when some :class:`torch.Tensor` are given to `SatAgg`, they have to be scalars in [0., 1.] since `SatAgg` is designed to work with closed formulas;
    - in this example, our knowledge base is composed of closed formulas `f1`, `f2`, and `f3`;
    - `SatAgg` applies the `pMeanError` aggregation operator to the truth values of these formulas. The result is a new truth value which can be interpreted as a satisfaction level of the entire knowledge base;
    - the result of `SatAgg` is a :class:`torch.Tensor` since it has been designed for learning in PyTorch. The idea is to put the result of the operator directly inside the loss function of the LTN. See this `tutorial <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bmxitalia/LTNtorch/blob/main/tutorials/3-knowledgebase-and-learning.ipynb>`_ for a detailed example.

    In the previous example, some closed formulas (:class:`ltn.core.LTNObject`) have been given to the `SatAgg`
    operator.
    In this example, we show that `SatAgg` can take as input also :class:`torch.Tensor` containing the result of some
    closed formulas, namely scalars in [0., 1.]. Note that:

    - `f2` is just a :class:`torch.Tensor`;
    - since `f2` contains a scalar in [0., 1.], its value can be interpreted as a truth value of a closed formula. For this reason, it is possible to give `f2` to the `SatAgg` operator to get the aggregation of `f1` (:class:`ltn.core.LTNObject`) and `f2` (:class:`torch.Tensor`).

    >>> x = ltn.Variable('x', torch.tensor([[0.1, 0.03],
    ...                                     [2.3, 4.3]]))
    >>> p = ltn.Predicate(func=lambda x: torch.nn.Sigmoid()(
    ...                                     torch.sum(x, dim=1)
    ...                                  ))
    >>> Forall = ltn.Quantifier(ltn.fuzzy_ops.AggregPMeanError(), quantifier='f')
    >>> f1 = Forall(x, p(x))
    >>> f2 = torch.tensor(0.7)
    >>> sat_agg = ltn.fuzzy_ops.SatAgg(ltn.fuzzy_ops.AggregPMeanError())
    >>> print(sat_agg)
    SatAgg(agg_op=AggregPMeanError(p=2, stable=True))
    >>> out = sat_agg(f1, f2)
    >>> print(type(out))
    <class 'torch.Tensor'>
    >>> print(out)
